## My process
- build html
- create css
- check and verify frequently with opera and its developer console
- consulting my own notes regarding usage of tags/options, consulting developers.mozilla.org and w3schools


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- editor: visual studio code

### What I learned

I already learned how to center horizontally and vertically with absolute positioning and translate so I used it here. I know you could use flexboxes as well, but I found this way more simple and quick. But I am not sure if this is the only/best way to do it.
Although the task is small I used variables for the colors, which is handy for bigger sites.


### Continued development

Learn more about positioning, especially centering.
